    <h3>Health & Safety Policy</h3>
    <p class="lead text-justify">
        Hawksmoor Construction Services Limited (HCS) recognises that good health and safety procedures and practices at work lead to the prevention of accidents and ill health. It is therefore a primary duty of all Directors, Managers, Supervisors and staff to maintain high levels of Health & Safety management.
        Accordingly, the Company is determined to ensure that it complies with the requirements of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and with the requirements of all other relevant legislation.
        Section 2 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 places a specific responsibility on the Company to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all our employees so far as is reasonably practicable.  The Act also requires us to ensure the safety of other people not in our employment who could be affected by any work we undertake.
        HCS expects high standards from its staff.  In order for this to be achieved, the Company will provide safe places of work at all locations where work is being undertaken.  This will be achieved by using competent trained persons to inspect sites, carry out risk assessments and to provide suitable method statements.
        All equipment and machinery used either at the offices and workshops or on site will be safe and without risks to health.  Regular inspections of the equipment will be carried out.
        All staff will receive adequate training, instruction, information and supervision to enable them to work safely in accordance with current accepted procedures.  All staff required to undertake inspections and to make reports will be competent and will have received training.
        All our premises will be suitably maintained and staff will be provided with suitable welfare facilities.
        All staff have duties under the Act to look after their own safety and that of others who may be affected by their actions.  Carelessness often causes accidents and this can be minimised by staff following safe procedures.  All accidents should be reported and all significant incidents will be investigated to prevent a recurrence.
